            Laurel Schwulst brings up an obvious yet unique idea that websites are not just an information forum, but also a piece of art.
            I feel that in out current society, the internet has become saturated with companies who soley use websites as a promotion tool that it becomes harder and harder to find websites that are just there to be there for fun. The fun essentially is fading away. Schwulst revitalizes the idea that websites can be anything we want it to be.
