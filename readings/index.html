        <h2> My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? </h2>
      
          
        <p>
            Laurel Schwulst brings up an obvious yet unique idea that websites are not just an information forum, but also a piece of art.
            I feel that in out current society, the internet has become saturated with companies who soley use websites as a promotion tool that it becomes harder and harder to find websites that are just there to be there for fun. The fun essentially is fading away. Schwulst revitalizes the idea that websites can be anything we want it to be.

        <h2> What is Code? </h2>
      
          
        <p>
            The article what is code dives deep into the definition of code, from the history to its application. Its brings to light, just how integrated computer softwares are in everyday life, from the cars we drive to the phone we use.
            What makes this article really interesting, however is not the application of code, but the idea of code itself. Seemingly very simple in terms of the concept itself, code is a vast language that is like magic... until you realize it's not. What we use to make everyday life easier, is an endless cycle of trial and error made by coders who combine logic and creativity to give us the luxuries we have today.

        <h2>Websites are the art of our time</h2>
         <p>
           This article is basically an essay about a website as a mode for art. Just like how new paint invented created new types of art, the internet is merely a medium in which art can be created. However the difference it that an empty art gallery has value, but an empty website does not. Websites have not just an aesthetic but a function.

        <h2>Google</h2>
        <p>
            This article is the best find I have ever come across. An entire language of how to design User interface is a great way to learn about what are the dos and don't of what it takes to make a good digital application. I'm am 1000000% going to utilize this when creating web and mobile applications of my own.

        <h2> A Handmade Web</h2>
        <p>
            This article talks about the idea of the "handmade web" or site that are entirely created and controlled by the coder/artists. In this day in age, "handmade" is seen as something special, sought after. With all the big companies taking over the web, individualized site are harder and harder to come by. "Handmade" is resurging in our generation of clean cut, basic sites, giving a little extra to users.
