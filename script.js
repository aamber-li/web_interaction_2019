/**
so for this each storline has a text, choice1, and choice2. Only once it reaches the end of a storyline does it have "end": true.
Please take note of where there are commas and where there are not. commas only appear if there are still more items left in an object
also keep note of where brackets are

if this is too confusing then keep it as it is and demo using my test scrip
you can ignore the script.json file. just make sure that that stays the same in case you mess up the script and you can just copy and paste it back in

last note my html is different from yours and i renamed some stuff so make sure it all works. CSS is just filler right now just to test it works

//work in css and html and then connect it to the js CHECK TYPOGRAPHY
